1-the difference between tag p and tag article
<p> creates a new paragraph, 
<article> is basically only a container,
alone it doesn't do anything, it just helps to keep the website organized.


2-difference between div tag and section tag
div is a generic container element that does not carry any semantic meaning.
It is mostly used for grouping related elements together and applying styling to them via CSS.
section , on the other hand,is a semantic element that represents a specific section of
a web page with a distinct topic or purpose.
